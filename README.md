Instead of solving the murder on the SQL Murder Mystery website, in this attempt the database file was downloaded, converted to a sql file through SQLite Database Browser.

The queries on the SQL Server Management Studio. The exported SQL syntax was edited slightly to work on the MS-SQL server. The syntax files are attached in the files.

A detailed report of the murder investigation and the investigation sql file are attached in this repository.

## Challenges
- The main challenge was tackling the various errors that were put forward due to syntax changes. This was tackled by executing the queries in chunks, step by step from table formation to value insertion.
- Creating a trigger for the solution was a grave hurdle since the syntax needed for MS-SQL was entirely different. I left this task for the end when I found out the killers through investigation. After which, after numerous trial and errors that could be rolledback using the transaction function, I implemented the solution trigger.

## Outcomes
- This SQL Mystery game is great for beginner moving onto intermediate levels.
- Downloading the database and importing the values added to the experience resembling a real-life work process.
- While setting up the trigger, I put my toes into higher level concepts and gained more knowledge about SQL functions.
